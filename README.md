# Numerical-Analysis
UCI In-Class assignments and projects done in Numerical Analysis classes (MATH 105A and 105B). 

File names with '_a' are done in MATH 105A. Used MATLAB to build numerical analysis algorithms, including univariate transcendental equations, linear systems, matrix inverse, matrix factorization, and iterative methods for eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 
hw1_a: Bisection method
hw2_a: Newton’s method
hw3_a: Gaussian elimination
hw4_a: Gauss-Jordan Algorithm
hw5_a: Matrix Factorization
hw6_a: Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method
hw7_a: SOR method
hw8_a: Application of Numerical Linear Algebra
final_a: applying above methods to 

Other files without '_a' are done in MATH 105B. Used MATLAB to develop algorithms for polynomial interpolation, differential equation approximation, and definite integral approximation.
hw1: Lagrange interpolating polynomial
hw2: Newton forward divided differences
hw3: Hermite interpolating polynomial
hw4: Natural cubic spline interpolating polynomial
hw5: Finite difference formulas for computing derivatives of functions (foward, backward, and central difference fromula)
hw6: Trapezoid and Simpson’s rules, as well as their composite formulas
hw7: Adaptive Simpson’s Rule
hw8: Adaptive Gaussian Quadrature
hw9: Chebyshev polynomial approximations
